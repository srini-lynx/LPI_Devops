Vagrant :

==> It's a tool for Building and Managing Virtual Machine Environments.
==> Machines are provisioned on top of a Provider 
        Ex:- Vmware,Oracle VirtualBox, Dockers ,Hyper-V ,AWS etc 

==> Provisioning tools can be used to automate tasks on machines , we can use tools such as SHELL Scripts, Chef , Puppet etc.

==>Custom Providers are supported , but they must be installed first and need to ensure all pluggins are installed for it to work.

Some Vagrant Commands:

vagrant init :Initializes the Current directory to be  a Vagrant environment by creating a Vagrantfile
vagrant up   : Creates and configures guest machines according to your Vagrantfile.
vagrant destroy : Stops the running and destroys all resources that were created
vagrant validate  : Validates your vagrantfile 
vagrant provision  :  Runs any configured provisioner 
vagrant reload  : Runs a halt followed by an up 
vagrant status     :  This will tell you the state of the machines 
vagrant ssh :  SSH into a running vagrant machine 

The Best part of VAGRANT is irrespective of Provider the command we are going to use is the same . Ex: vagrant up , vagrant provision , vagrant destroy ..etc.


Note: !!!!!  Manage One Vagrant File per Project   !!!!!
